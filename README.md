contains the secret sauce

There are strange things done in the winter sun by the men who moil for gold.
The arctic trails have their secret tales that would make your blood run cold.
The northern lights have seen queer sights, but the queerest they ever did see,
Was that night on the marge at lake Labarge, I cremated Sam McGee.
